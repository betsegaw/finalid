							<p>Every device will generate its own public and private key pair, with the private key never leaving the device.This key pair defines your identity and allows others to endorse your device's claim to your public identityNot only people, but entities such as online services and governmental institutions can acquire identities, participating in endorsing and being endorsed.This network of endorsements allows us to establish individual identity.</p>

Each person/entity verifying your identity will have a choice to accept your identity or reject it. While Final ID will provide recommendations when it can, the final call will always be yours </p>

                        <p>Beyond verifying you are actually a human being and not a robot, people can also endorse specific things about you, such as membership in a group. This allows you to establish and share your membership in the digital space. In situations where you might not want to share your identity but use your endorsements, Final ID, with a single TOFU per service, enables you to authenticate and prove yourself as a member of service without revealing your identity in an ongoing manner</p>

                        <p>While most of the high-level protocols have been worked out, we are still laying the foundations. We are building an initial, proof of concept prototype but will need a lot of help if these capabilities are to be implemented. If we are to achieve the goal of building an open-source, truly free, truly distributed solution for digital identity, we will need people of many skills participating.<br/><br/>This means we need your help in whatever capacity you can help.</p>
